/**
 * Where this build is served, and which address it claims to be.
 *
 * Nothing here is hardcoded to one person's site. Fork this repository, enable
 * GitHub Pages, push — and it builds correctly for *your* address with no
 * configuration at all, because the default is worked out from the repository
 * name at build time.
 *
 * Two optional environment variables, both full URLs ending in a slash:
 *
 *   SITE_URL        Where this build is actually served from. Assets, the
 *                   router and the fonts all resolve against it, so if it is
 *                   wrong the page loads and then nothing else does.
 *                   Default: https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/
 *
 *   SITE_CANONICAL  The address this build claims in its canonical tags,
 *                   sitemap and JSON-LD. Only differs from SITE_URL when the
 *                   same site is published at two addresses and one of them is
 *                   the address people should be given.
 *                   Default: the same as SITE_URL.
 *
 * This repository publishes twice, which is why the second one exists at all.
 * GitHub Pages sends a 301 from a repository's own Pages URL to its custom
 * domain and gives you no way to switch that off — so once dartajweed.com was
 * attached, edriso.github.io/learn-tajweed/ stopped being a fallback and became
 * a sign pointing at the domain. If the domain ever expired, both addresses
 * would break at once. A second repository serving the same files is the only
 * way to keep an address that does not depend on the domain being paid for.
 *
 * Both builds therefore claim dartajweed.com, so two copies of identical text
 * never compete with each other in Google. See the `mirror` job in
 * .github/workflows/deploy.yml, and the deployment section of README.md.
