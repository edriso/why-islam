/**
 * The pinned mushaf: where it is, and the checksum that says it is unchanged.
 *
 * Two scripts verify this file before trusting a single letter of it —
 * build-quran.mjs, which resolves every verse the lessons reference, and
 * build-og-image.mjs, which slices the verse printed on the share card. Both
 * used to carry their own copy of the hash, joined by a comment saying they
 * must match.
 *
 * Nothing silently went wrong when they drifted; both scripts fail loudly on a
 * mismatch. What did go wrong is that updating the corpus meant remembering two
 * places, and one of the error messages told you to edit "this file" — which
 * after a drift is the wrong advice. For the constant that stands between the
 * site and a misprinted mushaf, one copy is the only defensible number.
 *
 * To change it deliberately: run `npm run quran:fetch`, verify what you got,
 * then update the hash here and nowhere else.
