# How the Qur'anic text is verified

This document explains the one thing about this repository that is genuinely unusual,
and why it works the way it does.

## The problem

A site arguing from the Qur'an is made substantially of Qur'anic quotations. Copy a verse by hand and
you can very easily lose an invisible character: a tatweel, a superscript alef, a pause
mark. The result renders convincingly and reads correctly out loud, and nobody in code
review will ever spot it.

Publishing a wrong verse is not a bug. It is a wrong quotation of the Book of Allah.

## The solution in one line

> Nobody types a verse. Lessons cite a number; the build inserts the text.

## The moving parts

```
data/quran-uthmani.txt          the mushaf, 1.4 MB, checked in, pinned by SHA-256
data/surah-names.json           114 names + verse counts, so refs can be range-checked
scripts/fetch-quran.mjs         re-downloads both and refuses to write on a bad checksum
scripts/build-quran.mjs         the verifier + generator (runs before dev and build)
scripts/find-ayah.mjs           search helper for lesson authors
src/content/quran.generated.json   the output: only the verses the lessons actually use
src/lib/quran.ts                the tiny runtime that reads it
```

## What runs on every build

`npm run dev` and `npm run build` both start with `npm run quran:build`. That script:

### 1. Checks the corpus has not changed

```
sha256(data/quran-uthmani.txt) === 7f30c647331a61100ebf24a80507dc0fcdd9f2df97f1312b5b2dfcb982a7f326
```

If it differs, the build stops. Restore the file with `npm run quran:fetch`, which
downloads from Tanzil and refuses to write anything whose checksum does not match.

### 2. Parses the corpus and strips the basmala

Tanzil joins the basmala onto verse 1 of 112 surahs. We show verses on their own, so it
comes off. The basmala is taken **from verse 1:1**, never typed: a hand-written copy
differs by one invisible tatweel and silently stops matching.

Two surahs (al-Tin and al-Qadr) carry a basmala with a shadda on the baa, because the
surahs before them end in a baa. The longer form is tried first. The script asserts that
exactly 112 prefixes were removed, so a change in Tanzil's conventions would be caught
rather than absorbed.

### 3. Self-tests the Arabic normalisation

Four assertions run before anything else is checked. They exist because of a real bug:
the character ranges in these helpers were originally typed in Arabic, and a
bidirectional editor renders "from U+0610 to U+061A" back to front, so the range that
got saved was a completely different one. Every letter counted as a diacritic, every
phrase folded to the empty string, and every lookup "matched". Nothing threw.

**This is why every Arabic character class in `scripts/` and in `src/lib/arabic.ts` is
written with `\uXXXX` escapes.** The escapes are ASCII, so what you read is what the
regex engine sees. Please keep it that way.

### 4. Collects every reference in the repository

- ` ```ayah ` and ` ```quiz ` blocks, from their `ref:` fields
- `getAyah('73:4')` and `getSpan('73:4', '…')` calls with literal arguments in `.tsx`

Each reference is range-checked against `data/surah-names.json`: surah 115 or verse 300
of al-Fatihah fails immediately.

### 5. Resolves every highlighted phrase

A lesson writes phrases the ordinary way, without tashkeel: `highlight: من الصواعق`.
Resolving that to a character range in `مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ` is the interesting part.

The verse is reduced to a **skeleton**: diacritics, tatweel and pause marks are dropped,
and spelling variants are folded (`ٱ أ إ آ → ا`, `ى → ي`, `ة → ه`, `ؤ → و`, `ئ → ي`).
Each surviving character remembers where it came from, so a match can be mapped back to
real offsets in the original text.

The superscript alef stands for an alef the Uthmani script does not write, and a reader
may or may not spell it out. Three readings are tried in turn:

| mode | `ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ` | `ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keep` | الكتاب | الصلواة |
| `merge` | الكتاب | الصلاة |
| `drop` | الكتب | الصلوة |

Alef madda needs the same treatment for a subtler reason. The mushaf stores `ٱلضَّآلِّينَ`
as alef + U+0653, but `String.normalize('NFC')` fuses those into the single character
`آ`. A naive rule of "always expand alef madda into hamza + alef" therefore turns
الضالين into الضءالين and nothing matches. Both readings are produced and both are tried.

Two hard requirements:

- **Word boundaries.** A match must start and end on a whole word, so `من` never matches
  inside `مؤمن`.
- **Uniqueness.** If a phrase occurs more than once in the verse the build fails and asks
  for a longer phrase. Silently colouring the wrong occurrence would be worse than
  stopping.

When a phrase does not resolve, the error prints the verse twice, in Uthmani script and
as a skeleton, so the author can copy the exact form. That is the whole authoring loop.

### 6. Catches hand-typed Qur'an anywhere in the repository

Hamzat al-wasl, the superscript alef and the mushaf pause marks appear in the mushaf and
essentially nowhere else in ordinary Arabic writing.

- Text inside `«…»` containing any of them is checked against the mushaf.
- Two or more consecutive Arabic words containing any of them **outside** `«…»` is a
  build failure: wrap it or use an `ayah` block.
- A single word is allowed. A lesson has to be able to print `ٱ` on its own to show what
  hamzat al-wasl looks like, and one word is never a quotation.

### 7. Validates the lessons themselves

- Every YAML block parses (a colon inside Arabic prose is the usual culprit, and would
  otherwise throw in the browser and blank the page).
- Every lesson has its required frontmatter fields.
- Every `unit:` exists in `src/lib/units.ts`.
- No two lessons share an `order`.
- Every quiz `answer` indexes a real option, and no question is missing its `why`.
- Every `lesson:` slug in `glossary.ts` points at a lesson that exists.

### 8. Writes the output

```json
{
  "source": "…tanzil.net…",
  "ayat":  { "2:19": { "surah": 2, "ayah": 19, "surahName": "البقرة", "text": "…" } },
  "spans": { "2:19|من الصواعق": [83, 100] }
}
```

Only the verses the lessons actually use, so the browser downloads a few kilobytes
rather than the whole mushaf. The ranges are pre-resolved, so nothing is matched at
runtime and the page cannot disagree with the build.

**If anything above fails, no file is written and the build exits non-zero.** CI runs the
same command, so a broken reference can never reach the published site.

## Updating the corpus

Only if Tanzil publishes a genuine revision:

```bash
npm run quran:fetch     # fails loudly if the checksum has changed
```

If it fails, **do not just update the constant**. Diff the two files, read what changed,
and satisfy yourself it is a real upstream correction before editing `EXPECTED_SHA256`
in both `scripts/fetch-quran.mjs` and `scripts/build-quran.mjs`.
