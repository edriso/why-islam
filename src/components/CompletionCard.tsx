/**
 * What the reader sees when the last lesson is ticked.
 *
 * Two callers, one card. The lesson page mounts it with `celebrate` at the exact
 * moment the last remaining lesson is marked done, which is the only place the
 * burst plays. The home page mounts it in place of the progress bar for as long
 * as progress stays at 100%, with no animation: an entrance that replays on
 * every visit stops reading as a celebration and starts reading as a page that
 * cannot settle.
 *
 * The tone is deliberate. Finishing thirty lessons on why Islam is true is
 * worth marking, and it is also not the finish of anything: the verse below is
 * a du'a for *more* knowledge, and the card says plainly that the honest next
 * steps (asking Allah for guidance, and people of knowledge for what is still
 * unclear) cannot be read off a screen. A guide that congratulated the reader
 * into thinking they were done would be teaching the one thing it exists to
 * deny.
